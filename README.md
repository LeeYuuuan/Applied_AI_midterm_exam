## Introduction
This project implements a Super Resolution GAN (SRGAN) to enhance the quality of low-resolution images for a binary classification task. The aim is to train a generator to produce high-resolution images and a discriminator to evaluate them, ultimately improving the performance of a binary classifier.

## Dataset
- **Description**: Brief description of the dataset used.
- **Access**: Instructions on how to access the dataset.
- **Preprocessing**: Any preprocessing steps taken before training.

## Environment Setup
- **Dependencies**: List of required libraries and dependencies.
- **Setup Instructions**: Instructions on how to set up the environment (e.g., using Conda or pip).
- **Hardware Requirements**: Any specific hardware requirements (e.g., GPU).

## Model A: Binary Classifier
- **Architecture**: Description of the architecture used for the binary classifier.
- **Transfer Learning**: Explanation of the transfer learning process.
- **Training**: Instructions for training the model on downscaled images (128x128).

## Model B: SRGAN
- **Architecture Overview**: Overview of the SRGAN architecture (generator and discriminator).
- **Training Process**: Explanation of the training process and hyperparameters used.
- **Image Generation**: Details on how the SRGAN is trained to generate images (32x32).

## Training Process
- **Steps**: Steps taken during the training of both models.
- **Checkpoints**: Information on how checkpoints are saved (e.g., after every n epochs).
- **Challenges**: Any challenges faced and solutions implemented.

## Image Transformations
- **Normalization**: Description of normalization and other transformations applied to the images.
- **Examples**: Examples of transformed samples included.

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Metrics Used**: List of metrics used to evaluate both models (e.g., F1 Score, Accuracy, AUC).
- **Calculation**: Explanation of how these metrics were calculated.

## Results
- **Performance Comparison**: Comparison of the performance of Model A and Model B.
- **Visual Examples**: Visual examples of generated images from the SRGAN.
- **Discussion**: Discussion of findings and performance insights.

## Conclusion
- **Summary**: Summary of the project and its outcomes.
- **Future Work**: Future work and improvements that can be made.

## License
